            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is .com so commonly used,even by Giant companies like Facebook,LinkedIn,Github,to name a few?</h2>
            <p>Have you been seeing lots of sites ending with .com.Even big companies like Google, Facebook,LinkedIn,Github,etc have .com in their domain name system.Are you wondering what makes .com so special?
                <br>
                I have been thinking about it for a while,but did not bother to do the research,until the day, <a href="https://tanaypratap.com/">Tanay  Pratap</a> mentioned about it too,while educating us about the internet and web hosting,in one of his live sessions at <a href="https://neog.camp/guide/">neog.camp.</a>As much as I was fascinated by the way the internet works ,I was equally fascinated to know more about the .com top-level-domain. I am so glad to finally being able to share whatever I hcould gather on this note.
            </p>

            <p>In the late 19th century,the rapid growth of the internet caused major problems in keeping records. To deal with this problem and make internet navigation easier, <strong>Paul Mockapetris</strong> expanded the internet and invented Domain Name System(DNS) in 1983.in short, DNS is a hierarchical and decentralised naming system for computers,services or other resources connected to the internet.  </p>
       
             <p><strong>".com</strong>: introduced on January 1,1985,is the first ever Top-Level-Domain used after the Domain Name System(DNS) was first implemented for use on the Internet.So,it is safe to say, that this Top-Level_Domain has been in the game from the very first. And it is still in the game,leading.</p>
              <p>The name<strong>".com"</strong> derives its name from the term "commercial" depicting it's original intended purpose for domains registered by commercial organizations. Later, the domain opened for general purposes. It started to gain more and more popularity when non-profit organizations started using <strong>".com"</strong> </p>
              <p>Let us take a look at few possible reasons why this is so common and widely used-
                  <br>
                  <strong>1. ".com"</strong> is a generic top-level-domain. i.e, not specified for any particular purpose. 
                  <br
                  ><strong>2. ".com"</strong> does not have resgistration restriction . Unlike <strong>".in"</strong>(available to anyone; used by companies, individuals, and organisations in India) or <strong>".ca"</strong>( is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Canada.),to name a few. 
                  <br>
                 <strong>3.</strong> Since,being the oldest in the game, <strong>".com"</strong>, is the most trustworthy TLD(Top-Level-Domain):A URL people trust is more likely to get clicked on, linked to and shared. And it’s easier to build a brand with.
                  <br>
                  <strong>4. ".com"</strong>.com Top-Level-Domains are 33% more memorable than url's with other tTop-Leve-Ddomains. When a person ,mis-remembers an url,they are most likely to assume that it ends with <strong>".com"</strong>
                   <br>
                   <strong>5. Big Companies use <i>".com"</i>to demonstrate Authority,Trust and Longevity.</strong>
